## Background.
Many churches today are facing a similar grievance. Population and consequently membership has grown exponentially over time and the current manual systems of administrative management and communication are unable to keep up. 
It is becoming increasingly tiresome and inefficient for church leaders to manage their congregation, activities and events. 
This is where a Church Website and Management System comes in. The aim of this system is to digitize the churchesâ€™ administrative work for increased efficiency in running the church. It will be a significant improvement over current manual systems in place at some churches. It will be complemented by a website that will be used to communicate with church members and advertise the church to those who may be interested in joining.##
